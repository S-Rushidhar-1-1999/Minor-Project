Title: Stock Price Prediction

The art of forecasting stock prices has been a difficult task for many researchers and analysts. Investors are highly interested in stock price prediction, as accurate forecasting can lead to successful investments. A well-designed prediction system can help traders, investors, and analysts by providing supportive information regarding the future direction of stock prices.

[Wipro Stock Data (NSE)](https://www.nseindia.com/get-quotes/equity?symbol=WIPRO)

Dataset Features:
- Date: The date for each stock entry.
- Open, High, Low, Close: Various stock price points for the day.
- Prev. Close: Previous day's closing price.
- LTP (Last Traded Price): The price of the stock at the last trade.
- VWAP (Volume-Weighted Average Price): The average price of the stock, weighted by volume.
- 52W High/Low: The highest and lowest price over the last 52 weeks.
- Volume: The total number of shares traded.
- Value: The total value of the stocks traded.
- No. of Trades: The number of individual trades made.



Steps in Stock Price Prediction:

1. Loading Data:
   - The script begins by loading Wipro's historical stock data from a CSV file.
   - The dataset is cleaned by stripping extra spaces from column names and converting them to lowercase for consistency.

2. Feature Engineering:
   - Two new features are created based on moving averages:
     - 10-day Moving Average (10_MA): The average of the stock's closing price over the last 10 days.
     - 15-day Moving Average (15_MA): The average of the stock's closing price over the last 15 days.
   - These moving averages help smooth out short-term price fluctuations and highlight the overall trend of the stock.

3. Data Cleaning:
   - The script removes any rows with missing values (NaN), ensuring that the model only works with complete data.
   - If too much data is lost in this process, an error message is displayed, and the program terminates.

4. Visualization:
   - A plot is generated showing Wipro’s actual closing stock prices along with the 10-day and 15-day moving averages.
   - This visualization helps in understanding how the stock price moves in relation to these moving averages.

5. Preparing Data for Prediction:
   - The model uses two features for prediction: the 10-day and 15-day moving averages.
   - The stock’s closing price is the target variable, i.e., the value the model is trying to predict.
   - The data is then split into two sets:
     - Training data: 80% of the dataset, used to train the model.
     - Test data: 20% of the dataset, used to evaluate the model’s performance.

6. Training the Model:
   - A linear regression model is trained using the training data.
   - Linear regression assumes a linear relationship between the features (moving averages) and the target (closing price).

7. Making Predictions:
   - After training, the model is used to predict stock prices on the test data.
   - The predicted stock prices are compared to the actual prices from the test set to assess the model’s accuracy.

8. Model Evaluation:
   - The script evaluates the model's performance by calculating two metrics:
     - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): Measures the average deviation of predicted prices from actual prices.
       - RMSE: 8.8991
     - Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Measures the average absolute differences between predicted and actual values.
       - MAE: 7.1710

9. Visualization of Results:
   - A plot is generated to compare the actual stock prices and the predicted stock prices on the test set.
   - This visualization provides a clear representation of the model's performance.

10. Predicting the Next Day’s Price:
   - The model uses the most recent data (the last row of the dataset) to predict the closing stock price for the next day.
   - The predicted value is displayed as output.


Conclusion:
This project demonstrates a basic stock price prediction model using linear regression. The inclusion of moving averages as features provides insight into stock price trends. The model provides reasonable predictions.
